# LSTM_Beijing_Air_Pollution

We attempt to forecast the pollution levels (atmospheric particulate matters) for Beijing. 

We use a long short-term memory model, which is a neural network approach that lends itself well to sequential data as it is built in a way to retain 'memory' of data that it has learnt on before. I have also incorporated a new technique to cluster observations, which I learnt recently at work.
